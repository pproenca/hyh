  Workflow Files Analysis

  1. ci.yml - Main CI Pipeline

  Triggers: Push to main, pull requests, manual dispatch

  Key Jobs:
  - Linting: Rust formatting (rustfmt), Prettier, Python linting/type-checking, shell script validation
  - Clippy: Rust linter on Ubuntu and Windows
  - Testing: Unit tests across Linux, macOS, Windows with platform-specific features
  - Binary Building: Optimized builds for all platforms (Linux libc/musl/aarch64, macOS x86_64/aarch64, Windows, FreeBSD)
  - Integration Testing: Shell activation scripts, Python distributions (PyPy, GraalPy, Pyodide, CPython), package managers (Conda, Pyenv, Chocolatey)
  - Ecosystem Validation: Tests against Prefect, Flask, Pydantic

  Features: Concurrency groups, conditional execution based on labels, matrix strategies, 5-25 minute timeouts

  ---
  2. build-binaries.yml - Release Binary Building

  Triggers: Workflow call from release.yml, PRs affecting build files

  11 Parallel Build Jobs:
  - sdist - Source distributions for uv and uv-build
  - macos-x86_64 / macos-aarch64 - Apple Intel and Silicon
  - windows - x86_64, i686, aarch64 cross-compilation
  - linux / linux-arm / linux-s390x / linux-powerpc / linux-riscv64
  - musllinux / musllinux-cross - Alpine Linux builds

  Features: Uses PyO3's maturin, generates wheels + archived binaries, SHA256 checksums, skips on no-build label

  ---
  3. build-docker.yml - Docker Image Publishing

  Triggers: Workflow call from releases, PRs affecting Docker/project files

  Key Jobs:
  - docker-plan - Determines build/publish behavior
  - docker-publish-base - Builds main uv image
  - docker-publish-extra - 48 image variants (Alpine, Debian, Python versions matrix)
  - docker-annotate-base - Finalizes OCI annotations

  Registries: GHCR (ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv) and DockerHub (docker.io/astral/uv)
  Platforms: linux/amd64, linux/arm64
  Build Tool: Depot (Project ID: 7hd4vdzmw5)

  4. release.yml - Main Release Orchestration

  Triggers: Pull requests, manual dispatch with tag input

  Autogenerated by cargo-dist (v0.30.2)

  Job Flow:
  1. plan - Determines release tasks, generates manifest
  2. custom-build-binaries - Platform binaries
  3. custom-build-docker - Container images
  4. build-global-artifacts - Checksums and consolidated manifests
  5. host - Artifact hosting and release creation
  6. custom-publish-pypi - Python package publishing
  7. custom-publish-crates - Rust crate publishing
  8. announce - GitHub Release creation with attestations
  9. custom-publish-docs - Documentation deployment

  ---
  5. publish-crates.yml - Crates.io Publishing

  Triggers: Workflow call only

  Job: crates-publish-uv
  - Runner: ubuntu-latest
  - Environment: release
  - Command: cargo publish --workspace --no-verify
  - Auth: CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN secret

  ---
  6. publish-docs.yml - Documentation Publishing

  Triggers: Manual dispatch, workflow call

  Steps:
  1. Checkout with full history
  2. Setup Python 3.12, cache Rust
  3. Generate docs via cargo commands (options, CLI, env var references)
  4. Build MkDocs in strict mode
  5. Clone astral-sh/docs repository
  6. Create PR with changes
  7. Auto-merge for releases

  ---
  7. publish-pypi.yml - PyPI Publishing

  Triggers: Workflow call only

  Two Jobs:
  - pypi-publish-uv - Publishes main uv package
  - pypi-publish-uv-build - Publishes uv-build package

  Features: Uses OIDC trusted publishing (id-token: write), downloads wheel artifacts, uv publish -v

  ---
  8. sync-python-releases.yml - Python Release Syncing

  Triggers: Daily at midnight UTC, manual dispatch

  Steps:
  1. Run fetch-download-metadata.py in crates/uv-python
  2. Run sync_sysconfig_targets.sh in crates/uv-dev
  3. Create draft PR targeting main

  Purpose: Keeps Python distribution metadata current

  ---
  9. zizmor.yml - Security Scanning

  Triggers: Push to main, all pull requests

  Tool: zizmor (v0.1.2) - GitHub Actions security scanner
  Permissions: write security-events

  ---
  10. setup-dev-drive.ps1 - Windows CI Optimization

  Purpose: Configures optimal storage for Windows CI

  Logic:
  - Depot runners: Creates ReFS virtual disk at V:
  - Runners with D: drive: Uses existing drive
  - Other runners: Creates 25GB DevDrive on C:

  Exports: DEV_DRIVE, CARGO_HOME, RUSTUP_HOME, TMP, TEMP

  Configuration Files

  renovate.json5 - Dependency Management

  Features:
  - Dependency dashboard enabled
  - Scheduled Mondays 0-3 AM UTC
  - Managers: GitHub Actions, pre-commit, Cargo, custom regex

  Notable Rules:
  - GitHub Actions pinned to SHAs with semver annotations
  - Rust MSRV updates follow 85-day minimum age
  - Grouped updates: documentation refs, dev dependencies, pubgrub/version-ranges

  ---
  PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md

  Sections:
  - Contributor checklist (summary, title, issue references)
  - Summary section (purpose/rationale)
  - Test Plan section

  Key Patterns & Best Practices

  1. Reusable Workflows: build-binaries.yml, build-docker.yml, publish-*.yml are called from release.yml
  2. OIDC Trusted Publishing: PyPI uses id-token authentication (no stored credentials)
  3. Cargo-dist Integration: Release workflow is autogenerated
  4. Matrix Strategy: 11+ platform builds, 48 Docker variants
  5. Security: zizmor scanning, SHA-pinned actions, minimal permissions
  6. Conditional Execution: no-build label skips heavy builds
  7. Concurrency Groups: Prevents duplicate workflow runs
  8. Depot for Docker: Multi-platform builds via Depot infrastructure
